Jailbreaking iPhone 8 device with iOS 12.2 using Checkra1n on a Mac
You should be able to follow this for all Checkra1n semi-tethered jailbreaks that use Cydia  
Semi-tethered jailbreak 

Download Checkra1n from checkra.in - using beta release 0.12.3
1) Open dmg file on mac 
2) Drag to your applications 
3) Allow your mac to open the app anyway in your security and privacy settings 
4) Run the Checkra1n application and follow the instructions on the screen 
5) If all goes well, you're iphone will be jailbroken 
6) Open the Checkra1n app and it will show an app called Cydia
7) Click on it and click install 

SSH into Jailbroken iPhone 
1) On Cydia, search for OpenSSH by Bingner 
2) Install the app
3) On your computer, open terminal: $ ssh root@<device IP>
4) "Are you sure you want to continue connections"? Yes 
5) Now it will prompt you to enter the device's passwrod, default is alpine generally
6) I suggest you change this password since anyone on the same network as your phone will be able to ssh into it and login 
7) Happy hunting, now you can ssh into your device 

Faking your iOS version 
1) Install nano by Bingner from Cydia 
2) SSH into your phone or download iFile from Cydia 
3) Go to /System/Library/CoreServices 
4) Use your favorite terminal editor (I like nano)
5) # nano SystemVersion.plist
6) Look for <key>ProductVersion</key>
7) On the line below it is the iOS version of your device. Edit this to the version of your choosing.

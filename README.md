Hello! I'm Phoenhax (pronounced Phoenix). I'm a big Harry Potter fan and have been since before the age of 11. I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I was that I didn't get my letter (until about a decade later when my family mailed me an acceptance letter for my birthday :D ). 
</br></br>

I'm in pentesting and love it, but I'm not very good at remembering all the tools out there and how to use them. So I created this github to help myself keep track and keep notes on how to use the tools I experiment with. I figured this could be useful to others so I decided to make this project public. If you have any other neat tricks or other cool tools, please let me know! If I'm extremely slow to respond, I'm sorry. I'm new to Github and therefore still learning how to use and recognize when I have new notifications.

Hope you enjoy!
